* @recent_ids should really be part of the GTweeter class.
* It'd be nice to have a persons avatar show in the gnome-notify notification.
* Can gnome-notify be made to open the individual status page when clicked?
  * Or better: persons timeline when name clicked, status when text clicked, URL when URL clicked.
* Umm... tests...
* Package this so it's an easy install: `apt-get install gnome-notify-tweets` would be awesome.
